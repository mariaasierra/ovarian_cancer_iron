# Iron Chelation Therapy Elicits Innate Immune Control of Metastatic Ovarian Cancer 
This repository contains the script to analyze scRNA-seq mouse data from an ovarian cancer metastatic model.

Iron accumulation in cancer cells contributes to malignant progression and therapy resistance. While iron chelation can alter various hallmarks of cancer, the immune-modulatory effects of disrupting iron overload in tumors remains undefined. Here, we report that treatment with deferiprone, an FDA-approved iron chelator, induces potent innate immune responses that hinder ovarian cancer progression. Ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids treated with deferiprone upregulated gene programs implicated in type-I interferon (IFN) signaling and natural killer (NK) cell activation. Mechanistically, deferiprone caused mitochondrial dysfunction that induced type-I IFN production via cGAS-STING-IRF3, while activating DNA damage responses that enhanced the expression of DR5 and NKG2D ligands. Accordingly, deferiprone administration synergized with chemotherapy and extended the survival of mice with metastatic ovarian cancer by bolstering intratumoral NK cell infiltration and protective type-I IFN responses. Iron chelation may therefore represent an alternative immunotherapeutic approach for malignancies that are commonly refractory to T cell-centric modalities.
